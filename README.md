Sorry about your files, but I want to see how good you are at Wordle.

## What?
Amazing fun great awesome ransomware that encrypts files and makes you play Wordle to decrypt them.

## TODO:
- [ ] Guessing the same letter twice always makes the second instance yellow, even if there isn't a second instance of that letter in the word
- [x] ~~The guesses sometimes get inserted into guesses in an out-of-order position~~
- [ ] Clear the screen when guessing
- [x] ~~Throwing GuessTooShort and NotInWordList errors~~
- [ ] Make the error messages *fun*
- [ ] Make the error messages *red*
